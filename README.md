# Collection of Riemann solvers using SVE

This repository contains a collection of codes for the simulation of ideal gases using riemann solvers.

## Folders

### Folder: humid

About this folder: the humid folder contains a 1D upwind code to simulate advection.

This code solve the the motion of humid air using the 1st order upwind method.
